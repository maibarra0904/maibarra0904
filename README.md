# Mario Ibarra

## FullStack Developer

My name is Mario Ibarra, and my professional purpose is to consistently create measurable value within the organizations I engage with. I bring solid experience in Industrial Engineering and university-level teaching; however, in 2022 I made a strategic decision to expand my skill set into full-stack web development, aligned with my academic role in Computer Science. Since then, I have completed multiple specialized courses that have enabled me to design and deliver several practical projects, gaining hands-on exposure to modern web technologies and development practices. I currently hold a Master’s Degree in Software Engineering from UNIR, which strengthens my ability to integrate engineering rigor, educational insight, and contemporary software solutions to drive innovation and impact.
